## Why is this a thing?

Having 'conventional' assets available for investment outside the crypto space is (in my opinion) an important part of providing market stability. While stock and commodity brokers do provide crypto services there is a gap in the market that forces investors to offload crypto assets in favour of off chain investments.

Why not just use tether? Maybe you want to use a contract that is not pegged to the a fiat currency? Or maybe you want to use a contract with guaranteed asset backing, which could in theory be insured. 

what is a closed unit trust?
its opposite being an open ended unit trust, allowing people to buy units whenever, a closed unit trust has a set amount of investment units. 

why limit the units? less asset management fees, less exposure to market volatility.
